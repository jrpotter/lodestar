Lodestar						*lodestar*

Plugin for quick references of computer science related topics

Lodestar is a quickly accessable vim plugin conceptualized 
to contain computer science-related content such as data structures, 
algorithms, etc (though this is not strictly necessary).

Modify each lodes (found in $VIM/lodes by default) manifest file for
further configuration. Read the README.md file for instruction on how to 
do so.
